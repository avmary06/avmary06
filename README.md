## SIMCODES 2025 Project

**Title**: "Machine Learning-Enhanced Computational Modeling of Metal-Protein Interactions"

**Description**: Focuses on enhancing computational models of metal-protein interactions by integrating quantum chemistry, fragmentation methods, and machine learning. We will validate a fragmentation-based strategy, develop machine learning algorithms to predict metal binding in biological systems, and create scalable workflows for future therapeutic screenings. 

## Goals For The Internship
- Learn GAMESS
- Learn EFP
- Improve my Python and Linux skills
- Contribute meaningfully to the project
- Build a strong foundation for future MD/PhD studies
